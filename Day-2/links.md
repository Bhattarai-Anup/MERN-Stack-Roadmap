## üü¢ Easy (Foundations) ‚Äî 25 Questions

1. **Create a string variable called `username`.**  
   Assign your name as a string. Print the value and use `typeof` to check its data type.

2. **Create a number variable called `age`.**  
   Assign your current age to it. Use `typeof` to confirm it's a number.

3. **Use `const` to declare your `birthYear`.**  
   Then, try changing its value. What error do you get? Why is it not allowed?

4. **Declare one variable using each: `var`, `let`, and `const`.**  
   Modify their values if possible. Which ones let you reassign values?

5. **Create a string called `country` and use `typeof` on it.**  
   Confirm the type and explain what `typeof` is doing.

6. **Create a number variable for your `favoriteNumber`.**  
   Use `typeof` to check the type and describe why it shows ‚Äúnumber‚Äù.

7. **Create a boolean variable `isStudent` and assign `true` or `false`.**  
   Check its type using `typeof`.

8. **Declare a variable `middleName` but don‚Äôt assign any value.**  
   Log the value and type. Why does JavaScript say it's `undefined`?

9. **Assign `null` to a variable called `result`.**  
   What type does `typeof` show? Why is it `"object"`?

10. **Create `firstName` and `lastName` variables and combine them.**

14. **Evaluate this expression:**  
    ```js
    let x = "10" + 5;

    ```js
    let big = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    ```  
    What data type is this?

21. **Create a unique value using Symbol:**  
    ```js
    let id = Symbol("id");
    ```  
    What type is this and what‚Äôs special about it?

22. **Declare a `price` variable with a decimal like `9.99`.**  
    What data type is it?

23. **Try using different naming styles:**  
    Create variables with `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case`. Which ones work?

24. **Evaluate this expression:**  
    ```js
    let result = "3" * 2;
    ```  
    What is the output and why does this result in a number?

25. **Compare using `==`:**  
    ```js
    let a = "5";
    let b = 5;
    console.log(a == b);
    ```  
    Why is the output `true` even though one is a string?

    let number = parseInt(value);
    ```  
    What does `number` contain?

28. **Compare `undefined` and `null`:**

    What‚Äôs the result of `x == y` and `x === y`?

29. **Check types of `null` and `{}`:**  
    ```js
    console.log(typeof null === typeof {});

    What is the output? Why might this be surprising?

30. **Declare the same `let` variable twice in one block.**  
    What error appears?
